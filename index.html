               <b>Skin Cancer Detection</b><br><br>
                <p>TensorFlow has improved the precision of skin cancer diagnosis thanks
                    to its capacity for processing massive volumes of data and effectively
                    classifying photos. Deep learning algorithms have also made it possible
                    to develop extremely sophisticated image analysis tools that can spot
                    even the tiniest irregularities in skin lesions. TensorFlow's use in this
                    area has the potential to significantly enhance skin cancer early
                    detection and improve patient outcomes. Despite the encouraging
                    outcomes, more study and development in this field is required to
                    improve the technology and boost its accuracy even more.</p>
              <br><br>
              <b>Phishing Sites Detection</b><br><br>
              <p>The goal of this project was to design and implement a machine
                learning-based system capable of accurately detecting phishing
                websites. Phishing websites aim to deceive users into divulging
                sensitive information, and the project aimed to enhance online
                security by automating the identification of such malicious websites.</p>
        
            <h2>ACHIEVMENTS</h2>
            <p> • Solved over 200+ problems collectively on various coding platforms. <br>
                • Secured 1st Position in Basketball inter department competition
                (UTSAAH). <br>
                • Secured 1st Position in Tug-O-War inter department competition
                (UTSAAH). <br>
                • Secured 2nd Position in Volley Ball inter department competition
                (UTSAAH). <br>
                • Participated in ZONALS 2022 (Basketball). </p>
